# NLP-Project

## Objective

Train a model that can recognize a certain label by reading a text.

## Aug_data.ipynb

This file is for augmenting the data if you have few data. The more data you have the better the model will perform.

It needs the input of the file you want to augment.
It needs 2 inputs from that file: the texts and the labels.
Then it will save a new file with the augmented data.

## Preprocess.ipynb

This file does all the preprocessing of the data to get the most out of the model.

For this you will need to install french_lefff_lemmatizer.

You can do this by using this line in the terminal:
'pip install git+https://github.com/ClaudeCoulombe/FrenchLefffLemmatizer.git'
